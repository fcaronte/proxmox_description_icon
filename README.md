# Proxmox VE Icons Collection

This repository hosts a curated collection of icons specifically resized and optimized for use in Proxmox VE VM and LXC descriptions. The goal is to provide visually consistent icons to enhance the UI of your Proxmox setup.

## Icon Specifications
* **Dimensions**: Most icons are resized to approximately **110x110 pixels**. Some icons, such as Tailscale, have been adjusted to smaller dimensions to maintain visual consistency across the collection due to their original design proportions.
* **Format**: All icons are provided in **PNG** format for broad compatibility.
